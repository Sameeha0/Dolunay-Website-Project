      The Turkish drama series Dolunay (International title: Full Moon) premiered on Star TV from July 4 to December 31, 2017. It tells the story of Ferit Aslan, an extremely organized businessman, who hires Nazli, a gastronomy student, to assist him in his kitchen. As they work together, their differences become apparent—they are polar opposites in many ways. Despite their contrasting personalities, their journey takes an unexpected turn, leading to both personal and professional growth. The series explores how their dynamic evolves as they navigate their challenges and gradually discover the value of each other's perspectives.
